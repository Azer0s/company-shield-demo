## Progress so far

### Update 1 - 1h 15m down

* Created backend with auth (wasn't required but I really wanted to do it to refresh my Spring Security a bit)
* Mostly boilerplate code 
* Wrote in memory data structures with ConcurrentMap, transaction list still missing

#### Next steps

- [ ] Write a transaction repository
  - [ ] Use ConcurrentMap with String -> RingBuffer (don't want to implement myself, maybe there is one somewhere)
- [ ] Business logic
- [ ] Frontend
